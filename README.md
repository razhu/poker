# Exercise
Exercise 1 Write some code that will evaluate a poker hand and
determine its rank.

Example:

Hand: Ah As 10c 7d 6s (Pair of Aces)

Hand: Kh Kc 3s 3h 2d (2 Pair) 

Hand: Kh Qh 6h 2h 9h (Flush)

# Disclaimer
I did not have the time to learn the poker rules. I am going to assume that:

Hand: Ah As 10c 7d 6s (Pair of Aces) 2As -> 1 point

Hand: Kh Kc 3s 3h 2d (2 Pair) 2 pair-> 2 points

Hand: Kh Qh 6h 2h 9h (Flush) last letter is the same in the 5 cards -> 5 points

So, whoever has the bigger number wins!
